# calculus

Saga 2 of X_eTaL (see docs/plan.md). Milestones M0 (again, in the new
syntax) and M1 from docs/PRD.md. Replaces the archived saga
'foundations' (steps 1-7 done; its steps 3-4 implemented the earlier
syntax).

Specification: docs/lang-choices.md (decisions made with the user and
consistency-reviewed). It governs wherever older docs, tests or code
disagree. Ask the user before resolving anything it leaves open.

Rules for every step: strict TDD (failing test first, rejection tests
for every accepted form), tests are the spec (spec/**/*.case, crate
tests, proptest, reg-rs goldens in reg/), never resolve ambiguity
heuristically, class from tokens only, evaluator consumes Core only,
no panics on any input, run scripts/gate.sh (fmt, clippy, tests,
reg-rs, sw-checklist, markdown) before committing, commit (including
.agentrail/) before agentrail complete, push to origin/main.

## Steps

Goal: the implemented syntax matches `lang-choices.md` and renders
decorated and back losslessly (M0 again); the scalar functional
calculus evaluates (M1): `1 + 2` gives 3,
`u:s_quare := { _r * _r }; u:s_quare 7` gives 49,
`u:s_ub := { _l - _r }; 10 u:s_ub 3` gives 7, and a guarded recursive
factorial works.

| 1  | lexer-revision   | lexer to the new token set (names with one underline and a trailing mark, `u:` `c:` `l:` prefixes, `_digits` subscripts, `^` exponents on values, `:=` `->` `?` guards, `~` lazy parameters, quotes, strings, `#` comments, symbol digraphs `!=` `<=` `>=`, macros ending `<`, R2 `x!=3` error, newline and `;` tokens); rejection tests first; spec/lex re-written; goldens |
| 2  | render-revision  | Unicode render (underline core functions, prefix superscripts, subscripts, exponents, ligatures) and LaTeX output for the new syntax; round-trip proptest; spec/render and goldens; `docs/design.md` sections 2, 3, 8 and `docs/input.md` rewritten from `lang-choices.md`; README table and Life line; pending Life case in the new syntax |
| 3  | parser           | surface AST with spans: classes from tokens, right-to-left application, strands, exponents, axes, lambdas (`_l`/`_r`, named and `@` and `~` parameters), quotes, operand binding (F8/F9), `(expr)_` application, trains, guards, statements (`:=`, newlines, `;`), SC1 errors; ParseResult alternatives and `AmbiguousExpression`; ambiguity corpus; `xetal parse` |
| 4  | canonical-fmt    | canonical fully parenthesized printer, `xetal fmt`, `parse(fmt(parse x)) == parse x` proptest |
| 5  | core-desugar     | Core IR with NodeId and spans; desugar currying, lambdas, named and lazy parameters, operand binding, trains, guards, statements; normalization-equivalence tests; `xetal core` |
| 6  | scalar-eval      | strict evaluator over Core: Int / Float / Bool scalars with T1-T3 and D-10 rules, symbols, bindings and shadowing (M1), closures, currying, guards, `~` call-by-need (E1-E4), mutable `!` variables (M2), L7 shadowing warnings, printed results (10a) for scalars; `xetal eval`, `xetal run`, `xetal FILE`; M1 demos as reg-rs goldens |
| 7  | m1-docs-release  | README tour for M0/M1 with every command a golden, docs sync, saga retrospective |
